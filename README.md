To understand API automation properly, I created my own fake REST API using a local JSON server. I designed endpoints for users and subjects and validated complete CRUD operations through automation.
What I worked on:
• Created custom REST endpoints for testing
• Automated GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests
• Validated status codes and API responses
• Built JSON request bodies using JSONObject
• Executed tests using REST Assured and TestNG
• Tested APIs running on localhost
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of API testing fundamentals, request lifecycle, and validation logic using REST Assured.
